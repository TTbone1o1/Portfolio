                <h2 style="padding-left: 30px;">I have accomplished a great feat by reaching 200k followers on TikTok.
                     It is a reflection of my talent and engaging personality. I have also worked hard to be a 2024 upcoming graduate from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, 
                     which takes dedication and effort. Moreover, I am thrilled to have created my portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. It demonstrates my technical skills and ability to 
                     learn and adapt to new technologies. My achievements are a result of my determination, creativity, and technical savvy. 
                    I am proud of what I have accomplished and look forward to continuing to grow and succeed in the future.
